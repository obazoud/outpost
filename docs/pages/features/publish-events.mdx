title: Publishing Events
---

Once your first tenant is created, you can publish events to it. Events are published in one of two ways:

1. Publishing to a configured message bus queue that Outpost will consume
2. Making an HTTP POST request to the [Publish API endpoint](/docs/api/publish#publish-event)

Using the message queue allows for a higher publishing guarantee since there are no other dependencies other than the message queue, and you may already be publishing events requiring minimal change on your end.

Using the publishing API endpoint allows you to avoid implementing publishing to your service bus. It removes the initial publishing cost, but it adds the risk of the Outpost API being unavailable or returning an error.

The events need to follow the given structure:

```json
{
  "id": "123", // Optional but recommended. If left empty, ID will be generated by hashing the topic, data, and timestamp.
  "tenant_id": "12345", // The tenant ID to publish the event to; must match an existing tenant, otherwise it will be ignored.
  "destination_id": "12345", // Optional. Used to force delivery to a specific destination regardless of the topic.
  "topic": "something.created", // Optional. Assumed to match ANY topic if left empty. If set, it must match one of the configured topics.
  "eligible_for_retry": true, // Optional, defaults to `true`. Controls whether an event should be automatically retried.
  "time": "2024-06-01 08:23:36.082374Z", // ISO 8601 timestamp of the event
  "metadata": {
    // Arbitrary key-value mapping for event metadata.
    "key": "value" // String, number, or boolean
  },
  "data": {
    // Freeform JSON data
    "hello": "world"
  }
}
```

Each event (without a `destination_id`) is evaluated against all the registered destinations. An event is delivered and logged for each eligible destination.

The `metadata` is translated to the destination's native metadata; for instance, with Webhooks, they are translated to HTTP headers. If the destination does not support metadata, the metadata will be included in the event payload.

## Publishing from a message bus

Refer to the respective guide for the message bus you are using to publish events:

- [Publish from RabbitMQ](/docs/guides/publish-from-rabbitmq)
- [Publish from SQS](/docs/guides/publish-from-sqs)
- [Publish from GCP Pub/Sub](/docs/guides/publish-from-gcp-pubsub)

## Event Fanout

A message published to a topic is automatically replicated and sent to multiple endpoints. This allows for parallel processing and asynchronous event notifications.
