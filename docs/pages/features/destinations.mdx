title: Destinations
---

Outpost supports multiple event destination types. Each tenant can have multiple destinations, up to a maximum set by the `MAX_DESTINATIONS_PER_TENANT` environment variable (defaulting to `20`). Destinations can be registered either through the tenant-facing portal or with the API. The current supported destination types are:

- Webhooks
- Hookdeck Event Gateway
- AWS SQS
- AWS Kinesis
- RabbitMQ (AMQP)

Plans for additional event destination types include:

- GCP Pub/Sub
- Azure Service Bus
- Amazon EventBridge
- Kafka

> We recommend setting the `MAX_DESTINATIONS_PER_TENANT` value as low as is appropriate for your use case to prevent abuse and performance degradation. Updating the value to a lower value later will not delete existing destinations.

See the [roadmap](/docs/references/roadmap) for more information on planned destination types. To be eligible as a destination type, it must be asynchronous in nature and not run any business logic.

## Creating a destination

Destinations can be registered either through the tenant-facing portal or with the API. Since each destination type uses its own credentials and configuration, the required fields are different. Refer to the [Create Destination API](/docs/api/destinations#create-destination) for the required `config` and `credentials` fields for each destination type.

For example, creating a "Webhook" destination requires the `config.url` field.

```sh
curl --location 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>/destinations' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
--data '{
 "type": "<TYPE>",
 "topics": ["<TOPIC>"],
 "config": {
    "url": "https://example.test/webhooks"
 }
}'
```

## Getting Destination Types & Schemas

When using the API, you may want to build your own UI to capture user input on the destination configuration. Since each destination requires a specific configuration, the `GET /destination-types` endpoint provides a JSON schema for standardized input fields for each destination type.

For example, for the `webhook` type:

```json
{
  "type": "webhook",
  "label": "Webhook",
  "description": "Send events via an HTTP POST request to a URL",
  "icon": "<svg />",
  "instructions": "Some *markdown*",
  "remote_setup_url": null,
  "config_fields": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "URL",
      "description": "The URL to send the event to",
      "pattern": "/((([A-Za-z]{3,9}:(?://)?)(?:[-;:&=+$,w]+@)?[A-Za-z0-9.-]+(:[0-9]+)?|(?:www.|[-;:&=+$,w]+@)[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)((?:/[+~%/.w-_]*)???(?:[-+=&;%@.w_]*)#?(?:[w]*))?)/",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "credential_fields": []
}
```

### `config_fields` `Field[]`

Config fields are non-secret values that can be stored and displayed to the user in plain text.

### `credential_fields` `Field[]`

Credential fields are secret values that will be AES encrypted and obfuscated to the user. Some credentials may not be obfuscated; the destination type dictates the obfuscation logic.

### `instructions` `string`

Some destinations will require instructions to configure. For instance, with Pub/Sub, the user will need to create a service account and grant some permissions to that service account. The value is a markdown string to be rendered with any markdown rendering library. Images will be hosted through the GitHub repository.

### `remote_setup_url`

Some destinations may have OAuth flow or other managed setup flow that can be triggered with a link. If a `remote_setup_url` is set, then the user should be prompted to follow the link to configure the destination.

See the [building your own UI guide](../../guides/building-your-own-ui.mdx) for recommended UI patterns and wireframes for implementation in your own app.

## Customizing destination type definitions & instructions

The destination type definitions (label, description, icon, etc) and instructions can be customized by setting the `DESTINATIONS_METADATA_PATH` environment variable to a path on disk containing the destination type definitions and instructions. Outpost will load both the default destination type definitions and any custom destination type definitions and merge them.

The metadata path is a directory containing a `providers` directory with a subdirectory for each destination type. Each destination type directory contains a `metadata.json` file and an `instructions.md` file. You can find the default destination type definitions and instructions in the [outpost-providers](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/tree/main/internal/destregistry/providers) folder.
