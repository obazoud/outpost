Outpost is the first open source and self-hostable implementation of [Event Destinations](https://event-destinations.org) that enables delivery of your platform events directly to your user's preferred event destinations. It supports destinations such Webhooks, Hookdeck, AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, GCP Pub/Sub, AWS EventBridge, and Kafka.

Outpost is built and maintained by [Hookdeck](https://hookdeck.com?ref=github-outpost). It's written in Golang and distributed as a binary and Docker container under the Apache-2.0 license.

Outpost has minimal dependencies (Redis, Clickhouse and one of the supported message queues), is 100% backward compatible with your existing webhooks implementation and is highly optimized for high throughput low-cost operation.
